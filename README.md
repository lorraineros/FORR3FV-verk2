**a)** Rasterisation is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format and converting it into a raster image. Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.<br>
**b)** 
1. WebGL er Javascript-forritunarviðmót til að útfæra gagnvirkar þrívíðar og tvívíðar myndir í vafra.

1. GPU er tölvuíhlutur sem býr til myndiranr fyrir tölvuskjái, sér um vinnslunni.

1.  GLSL is a high-level shading language with a syntax based on the C programming language.

1.  Vertex in computer graphics is a data structure that describes certain attributes, like the position of a point in 2D or 3D space, or multiple points on a surface. 

1.  Primative are non-interactive, rudimentary elements displayed on a screen

1. Fragment In computer graphics, a fragment is the data necessary to generate a single pixel's worth of a drawing primitive in the frame buffer.

1. Pixel A pixel graphic is a computer graphic in which the image is represented by raster forms made up of pixels (points of colour). Each pixel represents one colour.

1. Clip space Clip space is where the space points are in after the point transformation by the projection matrix, but before the normalisation by w

1. View frustum is the region of space in the modeled world that may appear on the screen; it is the field of view of a perspective virtual camera system

1. z-buffering is the management of image depth coordinates in 3D graphics, usually done in hardware, sometimes in software

1. Right-hand coordinate system(RHS) is when the positive x and y axes point right and up, and the negative z axis points forward.

1. Frame buffer is a portion of random-access memory (RAM) containing a bitmap that drives a video display.

1. Shaders are simple programs that describe the traits of either a vertex or a pixel

1. FPS(Frames Per Second) is used to measure frame rate – the number of consecutive full-screen images that are displayed each second.

1. Refresh rate The refresh rate is the number of times the monitor updates with new images each second.
